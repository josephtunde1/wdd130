<h2>Joseph</h2>
<p>Howdy ya'll. Let me introduce myself. I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. 
It is the second most populous city in Africa with a population 
of over 15 million people. I grew up in a family of 6, with me
being the eldest of 4.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints all my life. I served in Nigeria in 2013 and I moved to Rexburg
in December, 2017.</p>
<p>Last semester, I worked as a teaching assistant for Networking Course.
I love sports and I play a lot of tennis and pingpong. I played soccer 
professionally for a while in Utah but I am also passionate about technology.
I like to consider myself a strategic thinker and I enjoy learning and 
understanding processes..</p>
